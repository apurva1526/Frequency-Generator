# Frequency-Generator

A Microprocessor Programming and Interfacing design project on Frequency Genetion along with Akshay Goel, V. Gautham and Aditya Shah.

This system is used to generate a Sine/Triangular/Square waveform of Frequencies ranging from 10 Hz to 99KHz. Voltage is between 0-10V. 
On system power up the you have to configure the desired type of waveform (square/triangle/square) , frequency and amplitude. To generate a Square Waveform of Frequency 9.35 KHz the user has to press square key, followed by 1K Key- 9 Times, 1K Key – 4 Times, 100 Key –3 Times 10 Key- 5 Times.
To select the Amplitude, the you will have to press Amplitude key and then press the 1V key “n” number of times where “n” is the peak to peak amplitude of the waveform to be generated. (only integer values of output voltages need to be generated) When generate switch should be turned on and then the frequency generation is enabled i.e., the square waveform of that frequency will be generated.
When frequency generation is enabled, if you want to change the waveform into another type for e.g. sine he just has to press sine. When a signal of different type/amplitude /frequency has to be generated, you will have to turn-off the generate switch and then configure the function generator as mentioned above.
